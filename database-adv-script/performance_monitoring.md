### ðŸ§  Explanation

- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to get detailed query execution plans and timing.
- Analyze the output to find slow steps such as sequential scans or expensive joins.
- Identify which columns need indexing or if schema changes are needed to optimize queries.
- Implement suggested changes like creating indexes on frequently filtered or joined columns.
- Re-run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to verify improved query performance by reduced execution time and cost.
- Continuous monitoring and tuning ensure the database performs well as data grows and usage patterns evolve.
